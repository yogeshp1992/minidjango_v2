1. `django-admin startproject <project-name>`
2. `python manage.py runserver`
3. Go to home-url, you will see default django welcome page
4. `django-admin startapp app1`
5. The only relative endpoint available at this stage is `/admin`
6. You cannot yet access `admin` page because `admin` is a application configured in `settings.py`
7. There are some pre-installed apps whenever we creat django project
8. For example `django.contrib.admin` is one of them
9. To access these projects we need to `makemigrations` & `migrate` first.
10. `python manage.py makemigrations` (detects changes related to application models)
11. `python manage.py migrate` (applies model changes to database)
12. Now you can access `admin` page, but you don't have application user yet.
13. `python manage.py createsuperuser`
14. I can log into admin interface using user created in above step.
15. You can now write new views in `views.py` file under application
16. We do URL binding of this view by adding URL mapping in `urls.py` file
17. We also need to register any new application that we create in `settings.py`
